# kongpose

Run [Kong API Gateway, Community Edition](https://konghq.com/kong-community-edition)
development setup with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).
Includes [Konga](https://github.com/pantsel/konga) as admin webapp.

Originally based on [Yuan Cheung's docker-compose-kong](https://github.com/zhangyuan/docker-compose-kong), with the following additions:

- Add [declarative configuration examples](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/kongpose/tree/master/examples)
  - Includes securing [Kong Admin API](https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/secure-admin-api/#kong-api-loopback)
- Use PostgreSQL 9.6 over 9.5, and Alpine Linux based image for smaller size
- Prefer `kong-migration` for initializing the database, rather than `setup.sh`
- Prefer Docker's own health checks, over using `wait-for-it.sh`
- Remove `bash` from built images, as it is not then needed
- Tidy up `docker-compose.yml`, removed `links` as they are not mandatory here
- Remove `start.sh` as `docker-compose restart` is a single command anyway
- Add MongoDB for storing Konga users
- Improve healthchecks for checking if database migrations have ran
- Upgrade Kong to 1.0.0rc3, use Alpine Linux based image for smaller size
- Upgrade Kong Dashboard to latest, to support Kong >= 0.13
  - though commented out in `docker-compose.yml` as Konga is enough


## Usage

    docker-compose up

See [examples of managing APIs with YAML](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/kongpose/tree/master/examples).
